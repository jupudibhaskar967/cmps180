1) If you are testing createview.sql multiple times
then uncomment the first line in the sql file. This is
just to make sure that the view is dropped.


2) In unittests.sql, I have added comment above every query.
In that the first 3 queries violates the foreign key constraints
and next 8 queries satisfy and violate the general constraints 
respectively. All of them are grouped together as mentioned in the lab3
description.


3) In queryview.sql, I have added comment (after the query) with 
answer of the query before the deletions. Now do the deletions 
and then run the query again and mentioned the result in second comment.
